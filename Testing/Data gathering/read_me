to start gethering data :

1) position your beacons carefully and measure the positions as accurate as possible
2) insert the positions in the "pos.txt" file
3) run the "get-n-pos.sh" script and wait for data to be collected
4) find your position data in the "test-accuracy.txt" file

IMPORTANT NOTE: the n samples in the gathering script is 10000, but of course you can change it to whatever you want
